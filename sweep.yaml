# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - All docstrings and comments should be up to date.
  - Do not include large chunks of commented out code.
  - Ensure that error logs use traceback during exceptions.
  - All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests in the same directory.
  - Avoid using debug log or print statements in production code.
  - Provide descriptive and informative descriptions in package.json.

description: Blitz ORM is a unique project that uses the Blitz framework to provide an object-relational mapping solution. It is built with TypeScript and follows the DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles. The project is structured around entities, repositories, and services, providing a clean and maintainable codebase. It also includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
draft: false

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: True

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.

# Example:
#
# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.
